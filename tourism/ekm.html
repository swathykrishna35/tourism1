    <p> southwest India's coastal Kerala state. It has been a port since 1341,
         when a flood carved out its harbor and opened it to Arab, Chinese and European merchants.
          Sites reflecting those influences include Fort Kochi, a settlement with tiled colonial
           bungalows and diverse houses of worship.
         Cantilevered Chinese fishing nets, typical of Kochi, have been in use for centuries.</p>
