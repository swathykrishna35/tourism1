    <h1>Kannur</h1>
    <p>Kannur is a coastal city in the south Indian state of Kerala.
         It was once an ancient trading port. Enduring monuments such as 16th-century 
         St. Angelo Fort, once occupied by European colonial forces, show the city’s significant
          role in the spice trade. Housed in a former palace, the Arakkal Museum highlights Kerala's
           one Muslim royal family.
         The palm-fringed sands of Payyambalam Beach run along Kannur’s western shore.</p>
